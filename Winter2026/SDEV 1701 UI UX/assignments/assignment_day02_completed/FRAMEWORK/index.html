        <h2>Main Characters</h2>
        <img src="img/link_with_the_cast.avif" alt="From Left to right: Zelda, Link, Revali" width="1000">
        <h3>Link</h3>
        <p>
            Link is the silent protagonist and hero of Hyrule. In Breath of the Wild, he awakens from a long slumber of one hundred years, having been gravely injured during the fall of the kingdom. He rises into a land now shattered, scattered with the ruins of its past and haunted by the looming threat of Calamity Ganon. Link is driven not just by duty, but also by the slow recovery of his memories—visions of a princess, of battles fought, and of promises made. As players guide him through forests, deserts, mountains, and shrines, Link becomes more than just a warrior—he is a symbol of hope and quiet resilience.
        </p>
        <h3>Zelda</h3>
        <p>
            Princess Zelda in this installment is complex, intelligent, and burdened with deep personal conflict. She is not just a damsel in distress, but a key figure in Hyrule's resistance. Zelda struggles with her own doubts and the pressure of destiny—she is expected to awaken a sacred power, yet it eludes her for much of the game. Through recovered memories and flashbacks, we witness a Zelda who is earnest, scholarly, and emotionally vulnerable. Her ultimate act of sacrifice is to contain Calamity Ganon within Hyrule Castle for a century, holding back his power alone until Link can return to finish what they began together.
        </p>
        <h3>Revali</h3>
        <p>
            Revali is the Rito Champion and pilot of the Divine Beast Vah Medoh. He is arrogant, sharp-tongued, and possesses unmatched skill with a bow. His confidence often comes across as cold or dismissive, especially toward Link, whom he sees as an undeserving hero. Yet beneath this bravado lies a fierce loyalty to Hyrule and his people. Revali’s story arc explores themes of pride, rivalry, and the difficulty of working alongside others when your ego gets in the way. His aerial combat abilities, combined with his unique personality, make him one of the most memorable Champions in the game.

        <h2>The Kingdom of Hyrule</h2>
        <p>
        The setting of Breath of the Wild is a vast, decayed version of Hyrule, once a thriving kingdom now overrun by wild nature and ancient mechanical beasts. Unlike past Zelda games, this version of Hyrule offers complete freedom to explore from the very start. Players can climb nearly any surface, glide across valleys, and cook meals from wild ingredients found across the land. Weather systems, enemy behavior, and physics-based puzzles all contribute to a deeply immersive and reactive world. Shrines scattered across the kingdom replace traditional dungeons, and each one offers unique challenges that reward creative thinking and problem-solving. 
        </p>
        <h2>Game Development and Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Breath of the Wild was developed by Nintendo and released in 2017 as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. It represented a radical departure from previous entries in the series, emphasizing exploration, experimentation, and player agency. Developers deliberately broke many long-standing Zelda conventions, such as linear dungeon progression and unbreakable weapons, in order to build a world that feels alive and unpredictable. The gamble paid off—critics praised its design, art direction, and storytelling. It won numerous Game of the Year awards and is now considered one of the most influential video games of all time, inspiring a wave of open-world titles focused on freedom and discovery.
        </p>
        <h2>A fun Bit of Trivia</h2>
        <p>
        Although players are free to confront Calamity Ganon almost immediately after the game begins, most choose to spend dozens—or even hundreds—of hours exploring the world instead. Whether it's taming a wild horse, gliding off a mountaintop, or stumbling across a mysterious Korok, Breath of the Wild invites players to slow down, get lost, and find their own story in the ruins of a fallen kingdom.
